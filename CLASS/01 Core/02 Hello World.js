/*
Create a new react app with the name 'hello-world' ==> npx create-react-app hello-world

What is npx ?
npx is a package we get access to when we install node..
create-react-app on the other hand is also a separate npm package we need to install to be able to use it to create a react app but with npx we can make use of it without having to install it..

So npx is a package runner dt allows us to make use of a package without having to install it...

We can also follow another approach of installing create-react-app first globally and then use it to create our app
