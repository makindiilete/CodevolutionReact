/*
React on its own being a library does not have a way of making http calls, it does not even have business with your server... Its business is to render the UI using the props and state supplied to it... So you need to find a way to get the data from your server into your component prop/state using any http library of your choice...

1-  We can use the popular 'axios' library for communicating with out server..
    npm i axios
